In the process of learning R, we discovered a few tips and tricks which we think would be useful for new learners of R. We share 2 ideas here:
1. **stat_density_ridges**, to best present boxplots and ridgeline plots, in an uncluttered fashion.
2. Curated **keyboard shortcuts** we found to be most useful, to maximise productivity for the power-user

We share how to use them in the video, the [curated keyboard shortcuts in the PDF]([[url](curated keyboard shortcuts in the PDF)https://github.com/limyuzheng88/EDAV_Community_Contribution_grp4/blob/main/Rstudio_Keyboard_Shortcuts.pdf], and the code to produce the plots using stat_density_ridges.
