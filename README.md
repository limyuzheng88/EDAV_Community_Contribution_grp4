In the process of learning R, we discovered a few tips and tricks which we think would be useful for new learners of R. We share 2 ideas here:
1. **_stat_density_ridges_**, to best present boxplots and ridgeline plots TOGETHER, in an uncluttered fashion.
2. Curated **keyboard shortcuts** we found to be most useful, to MAXIMISE PRODUCTIVITY for the power-user

We share how to use them in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40MokoiI3Aw), the [curated keyboard shortcuts in the PDF](https://github.com/limyuzheng88/EDAV_Community_Contribution_grp4/blob/main/Rstudio_Keyboard_Shortcuts.pdf), and the [code](https://github.com/limyuzheng88/EDAV_Community_Contribution_grp4/blob/main/Community_Contribution.qmd) to produce the plots using _stat_density_ridges_.
